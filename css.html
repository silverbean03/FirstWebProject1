            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
                XHTML).[1]
                CSS is a
                cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This
                separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its
                presentation;
                provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
                multiple
                web pages to
                share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                repetition in the
                structural content.
